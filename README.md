# Jisc Innovation Expo

Repository for the Jisc internal Innovation Expo

Due to data confidentiality we cannot demo the code using the DEI data, therefore Amazon Review data was chosen as the closest type of data to survey responses. Individuals write reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website.

Data for this demo obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products).
The CSV is titled 'Datafiniti_Amazon_Consumer_Reviews_of_Amazon_Products_May19.csv'

Full documentation for Qualkit available from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JiscDACT/qualkit).
